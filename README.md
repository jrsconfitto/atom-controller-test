atom-controller-test
====================

A quick app to test using a controller in Atom

i'm going to see if i relegate polling the gamepad API to a web worker instead of doing `requestAnimationFrame` all the time.

Then i want to see if i can hook RxJS up to the whole thing to generate events.

This playground is mainly in service of [kart](https://github.com/maddox/kart). :warning: This project may not live long.
